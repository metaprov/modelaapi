# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.  The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Features in Alpha or Beta stage are tagged as such. We try to follow the same conventions as
Kubernetes for [feature development
stages](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions).

Some experimental features can be enabled / disabled using [Feature Gates](docs/feature-gates.md).
