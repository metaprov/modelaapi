                              New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                              describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                              fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                              honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                              are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                              usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, "must refer only to types
                              A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                              and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                              5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                              embedded in many locations, updates to this type will
                              affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed
                              an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead
                              of using this type, create a locally provided and used
                              type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                                  such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For
                                  example, if the object reference is to a container
                                  within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                                  (where "name" refers to the name of the container
                                  that triggered the event) or if no container name
                                  is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                  index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only
                                  to have some well-defined way of referencing a part
                                  of an object. TODO: this design is not final and
