                                    --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                    of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                                    in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                                    fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                                    ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                                    valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                    is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                                    restrictions like, "must refer only to types A
                                    and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                                    Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                                    3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                                    are different, the validation rules are different
                                    by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                                    what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                    and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                                    to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                                    dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                                    the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                    5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                                    type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make
                                    new APIs embed an underspecified API type they
                                    do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused
                                    on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                                    --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                    of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                                    in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                                    fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                                    ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                                    valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                    is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                                    restrictions like, "must refer only to types A
                                    and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                                    Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                                    3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                                    are different, the validation rules are different
                                    by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                                    what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                    and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                                    to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                                    dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                                    the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                    5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                                    type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make
                                    new APIs embed an underspecified API type they
                                    do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused
                                    on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                                    for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                                        statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                        For example, if the object reference is to
                                        a container within a pod, this would take
                                        on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where
                                        "name" refers to the name of the container
                                        that triggered the event) or if no container
                                        name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container
                                        with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is
                                        chosen only to have some well-defined way
                                        of referencing a part of an object. TODO:

                                    --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                    of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                                    in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                                    fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                                    ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                                    valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                    is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                                    restrictions like, "must refer only to types A
                                    and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                                    Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                                    3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                                    are different, the validation rules are different
                                    by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                                    what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                    and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                                    to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                                    dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                                    the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                    5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                                    type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make
                                    new APIs embed an underspecified API type they
                                    do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused
                                    on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                                    --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                    of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                                    in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                                    fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                                    ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                                    valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                    is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                                    restrictions like, "must refer only to types A
                                    and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                                    Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                                    3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                                    are different, the validation rules are different
                                    by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                                    what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                    and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                                    to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                                    dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                                    the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                    5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                                    type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make
                                    new APIs embed an underspecified API type they
                                    do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused
                                    on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                                        name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container
                                        with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is

                                    --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                    of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                                    in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                                    fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                                    ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                                    valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                    is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                                    restrictions like, "must refer only to types A
                                    and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                                    Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                                    3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                                    are different, the validation rules are different
                                    by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                                    what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                    and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                                    to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                                    dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                                    the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                    5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                                    type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make
                                    new APIs embed an underspecified API type they
                                    do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused
                                    on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                                    for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                                        statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                        For example, if the object reference is to
                                        a container within a pod, this would take
                                        on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where
                                        "name" refers to the name of the container
                                        that triggered the event) or if no container
                                        name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container
                                        with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is
                                        chosen only to have some well-defined way
                                        of referencing a part of an object. TODO:
