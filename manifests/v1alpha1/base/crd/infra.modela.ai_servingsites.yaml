                  Ingress resource which the ServingSite uses to define external access
                  points for resources that accept HTTP-based traffic to their services
                  (i.e. DataApps). This field is set only after one or more resources
                  are created which use the Ingress access method to serve REST traffic.
                  If there are no Ingress rules to serve then the Ingress will be
                  destroyed
