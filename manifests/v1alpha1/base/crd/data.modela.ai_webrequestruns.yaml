                                --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in
                                APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                                which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                                and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual
                                usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                                add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                                usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must
                                refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                                or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well
                                described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                                the usages are different, the validation rules are
                                different by usage, which makes it hard for users
                                to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both
                                imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                                mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                                interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                                cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                                and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                                is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                                will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs
                                embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                                Instead of using this type, create a locally provided
                                and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                                    contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement,
                                    such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For
                                    example, if the object reference is to a container
                                    within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to
                                    the name of the container that triggered the event)
                                    or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                                    (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax
                                    is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
